      <div class="description">
        The web has become a large and complex area for application development.
        Access to an abundance of open source languages, libraries, and
        frameworks has led to the quick and easy construction of a variety of
        applications with several moving parts working in coordination to
        present to the user the illusion of a single program. In reality, web
        applications are extremely difficult to get right. They involve a large
        collection of coordinated services, multiple databases, complicated user
        interfaces, security and performance issues, and ever changing 3rd party
        services, spread across physical and virtual machines. These
        complications are further stressed by the large number of concurrent
        users that access these applications every second. This course will
        investigate several well known web-based applications and the technology
        and software architecture used to scale these applications. We will also
        study a specific topic related to scalability in software design in the
        context of web application architecture. This course counts as an
        Elective for the CS and INFORM Majors. Prerequisite: COMPSCI 320 or
        COMPSCI 326 with a grade of C or better. 3 credits.
